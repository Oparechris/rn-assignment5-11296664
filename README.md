This is a React Native-built smartphone application. The software has two screens, Home and Settings, with a bottom tab navigation. Users can alternate between light and dark themes using the application's theme change feature.

I built the program by creating unique components that closely matched the given user interface design. I provided a function to toggle the theme and utilized a ThemeContext to hold the current theme. I then styled the application's components using this context.
